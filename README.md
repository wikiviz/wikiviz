# wikiviz

Wikiviz is a Wikipedia Visualization application. Wikiviz graphically represents related content from Wikipedia, allowing users to discover new concepts and develop a contextual understanding of the relationships between ideas. Wikiviz is currently in progress, and is part of a student project at the University of Louisville.

*	Network module: takes requests from Parser to retrieve page data from Wiki for parsing

### Requirements
*	Python 2.7
*	Kivy 1.8
*	BeautifulSoup 4

### Installation
You must use Kivy to build and run the application from source:
